# MacOSPhotosVideoTimeStampSetter
In macOS Photos app, when importing videos, for some file formats or files from some specific phones or cameras, the timestamp of the video is set as imported time instead of the actual time stamp of the video. The script corrects the timestamp of the video based on the timestamp from the file name. In future, setting from modified/created time stamp is planned.
